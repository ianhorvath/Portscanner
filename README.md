Port Scanner

Let's be real, ok? Port Scanners are awesome, but they should be used responsibly, and by using this code you are pledging to use this port scanner in the most stict of legal matters. So no hammering websites which you do not like, don't attack your ex-girlfiend's blog site, or your current employer. Just use it internally to find ports which maybe open and decide what to do with them, ok? Be an adult and you will be treated like one, and make the world a better place. 
This was developed for a class at university, so I hope to be continually improving on it and most importantly, if you have suggestions or guideance on how to improve it, well reach out! Let's talk, I am ways open to new ideas, and fully admit that I am a beginner on the road to meet the great Python prince in the everlasting land of milk and honey. 

Again snicklefritz, use at your own risk and be safe out there. 

This port scanner can do several things:
  1. scan all ports of one host
  2. scan select ports of one host
  3. save recursive results to txt & html
  4. teach you a lot about how to make something, and tear it down again, then make it again.
